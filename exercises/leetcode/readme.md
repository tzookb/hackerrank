# Programming Chanllenges

I loved doing some sharp programming challenges.
I started from Hackerrank but then found so many other great spots to play with.

I would try to make things easilly accessible with links from this readme,
but you can always search on github search bar. I always name the exercises as their
name in the challenges site.
