This is the first exercise I'm creating a detailes readme file.

I just updated my [personal blog](https://tzookb.com), that is built with Gatsby, to automatially add my Github exercise solutions as blog posts.
I'll probably add a post detailing that, but lets get back to the solution for this exercise.


```
print("somecode")
//no lang
```
