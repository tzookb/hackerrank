# Programming Chanllenges

I really enjoy solving algorithm challenges.
This repo is mainly for me to store all my solutions and hopefully help others that look for a solution or want to see different approches.

I would try to make things easilly accessible with links from this readme,
but you can always search on github search bar. I always name the exercises as their
name in the challenges site.

## Algorithms Sites

- [HackerRank](hackerrank/readme.md)
- [LeetCode](leetcode/readme.md)
- [Coditility](coditility/readme.md)
